# Pong Game 🎮

A modern recreation of the classic **Pong game** using Python's `turtle` module. Two players control paddles to keep the ball in play, with scoring and boundary mechanics for an engaging experience.

---

## 📜 Features
- **Two Paddles**: Independent controls for both players.
- **Ball Dynamics**: Smooth ball movement with realistic bouncing mechanics.
- **Scoring System**: Tracks points for both players and displays the score on the screen.
- **Wall and Paddle Collision**: Ball bounces off walls and paddles, resetting if it goes out of bounds.
- **Keyboard Controls**: Smooth and responsive input handling.
