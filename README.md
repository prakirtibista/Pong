# Pong
This project is a simple Pong game implemented using Python's turtle module. It includes two paddles (left and right) controlled by player inputs, a moving ball, and collision detection with walls and paddles. The game logic ensures smooth paddle movement and ball bouncing, providing a nostalgic recreation of the classic arcade game.
